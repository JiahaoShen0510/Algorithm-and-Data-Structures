The collection of algorithms and data structures solutions that implemented with the JavaScript.

## Solution Summary:

### 01) Add Number to Total: 
Calculate the number that add from 1 to the n, and only add all even or odd numbers in the n. Implement with both while and for loop. 

### 02) Calculate Character:
Calculate the frequencies of every character and number in the given paragraph. 

### 03) Check Same Frequency:
Check if two arrays are in the same frequency, which the numbers in first array should exactly match the squared numbers in second array. 

### 04) Anagram Game:
Check if two words are complied with the Anagram rule, which they should have exactly the same characters but in different orders. Only the alphabets are allowed.

### 05) Find First Pair Sum Zero in Sorted Array:
Sort the given array of numbers and identify the first pair that sum up at zero, which usually will be the pair of negative and positive numbers have the same absolute value. 

### 06) Count Unique Value in Sorted Array:
Sort the given array of numbers and count the all unique values in it. 

### 07) Max Value of Contiguous Subarray in Given Number:
Calculate the maximum values of a contiguous subarray, which the size of subarray is determined by the given dimension that should lower than the length of whole array. 

### 08) Minimum Length Contiguous Subarray in Given Number:
Calculate the minimum length of contiguous subarray which the sum of values greater or equal to the given number. 

### 09) Calculate Longest Length of Contiguous Strings:
Calculate the longest length of contiguous unique strings in the given word. 

### 10) Rotate Array from Right in Given Number:
Rotate the order of numbers in a array from right to left, which the numbers rotated will be determined by the given number.
